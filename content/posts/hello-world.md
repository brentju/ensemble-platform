Welcome to the Ensemble journal.

We explore product development with agent-based testing, design that respects focus, and tooling that cleanly and seamlessly integrates into your existing workflows.

## What to expect

- Notes on best practices in UI/UX development and testing
- Elegant and accessible UI patterns that scale
- Updates on our product and where we're going

## Who are we?

Brent and Brian are two CS graduates from Stanford University who believe the development quality products shouldn't be compromised by waiting on feedback cycles.

Our thesis is that agents can reliably and accurately behave like a real user would, both their expected and unexpected behaviors. 

In recent months we’ve seen groundbreaking research that shows (1) LLMs can reliably and consistently mirror human behavior and personality and (2) software tools and protocols such as MCP and A2A are enabling agents to interact with websites and produce evidence artifacts (screenshots, videos) akin to what real users would. 

We’re focusing on this because we personally face this problem everyday at work, as do countless other developers. 

Brian scaled user facing interfaces to thousands (while optimizing for military-grade security and latencies) and researched at Stanford’s HCI lab. Brent has worked at companies ranging from early stage startups to well-established names in big tech, most recently building AI agents at Google. **We’re confident we’re the team to build this.**
